# glgif

## What is it?

glgif is a fast and comprehensive library for playing back .gif animations on the iPhone using OpenGLES.

## Sounds great, how do i use it?

At the core, glgif merely uploads frames from a gif animation to an OpenGLES texture. So the first thing you need to do is be sure to link the OpenGLES and QuartzCore frameworks to your app. Then, add the glgif files to your project (including the lungif subdirectory). After that, all you need to do is the following:

    // Load the gif
    FILE *fp = fopen("test.gif", "r");
    VideoSource *src = VideoSource_init(fp, VIDEOSOURCE_FILE);
    
    // Init video using VideoSource
    GifVideo *vid = [[GifVideo alloc] initWithSource:src inContext:[yourGLESContext]];
    VideoSource_release(src);
    
    // Start playing the video
    [vid play:YES];
    
    // Then every frame...
    [vid getFrame]; // grab new frame data
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, vid.tex->tex); // bind the video texture!
    
## Whoah, that is so complicated. Is there an easier way?

Why yes, indeed there is! An example project has been included which implements a nice OpenGLES view to display a test .gif. So all you need to do once you make a GifVideo* is:

    [playerView startAnimation:vid]; 

## Do any cool iPhone applications use this code?
